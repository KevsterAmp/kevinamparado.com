# hey

I’m a big **linux and neovim nerd**, which kind of naturally led me into **working in devops**.

<br>

honestly, I’m kind of lazy — which is exactly why **I’m always spotting inefficiencies and finding ways to improve or automate things**.

<br>

aside from devops' **infra management and config hell**,

- I work and maintain legacy ETLs.

- sometimes investigate, analyze and/or scrape data
