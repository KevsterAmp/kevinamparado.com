# hey

I’m a big linux and neovim nerd, which kind of naturally led me into working in devops.

<br>

Honestly, i'm pretty lazy. I easily spot inefficiencies and menial processes, I always push and try to automate and improve it.

<br>

I’ve done everything from simple _bash scripts_ to building more _complex internal CLI tools_ and setting up _GitLab CI pipelines_.

<br>

aside from infra management and config hell,

- I handle 100% of the bugs and issues in our _largest legacy ETL_.

- I became the _contact person_ of the data team for the ETL migration.
  <br>

If you think I'm what you're looking for, feel free to [email]() me.
